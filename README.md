Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

the aim is to caryy out LDA on this dataset so that we have a few important variables that can be used to predict on whether tha patient has breast cancer or not.
